This repository contains assignment submissions made in the course CS641 (2022-23 II Sem.) at IIT-K in a team of three (Priya ["priyagole"](https://github.com/priyagole) Gole, Shrilakshmi ["shrilakshmisk"](https://github.com/shrilakshmisk) S K and me, Aditya ["cliche-niche"](https://github.com/cliche-niche) Tanwar).

### Notes
The notes that I made for this course can be found [here](./Notes.pdf). I would like to acknowledge Prof. Manindra Agrawal for these notes since I could make them only with the help of his lectures and lecture slides.

### Assignments

The solutions (only the commands used) for each assignment have been provided in [Solutions](./Solutions.md). <br>
The assignments were in the form of (CTF) "games" in which we were supposed to figure out passwords using different cryptanalytic techniques and the hints provided. A brief overview of each assignment has been given below:

+ [Assignment 1:](./A1/) Substitution ciphers <br> Awarded 43/50 
    + -2 for not mentioning Monoalphabetic
    + -5 for not mapping punctuation marks to themselves
+ [Assignment 2:](./A2/) Vigenere cipher <br> Awarded 65/65
+ [Assignment 3:](./A3/) Substitution Permutation Network <br> Awarded 48/50
    + -2 for not mentioning block length
+ [Assignment 4:](./A4/) 6-round DES <br> Awarded 95/100
    + -5 for not mentioning number of pairs required <br>

    Remark: Code is not complete since the team could not break this assignment.
+ [Assignment 5:](./A5/) AES variant <br> Awarded 100/100

There were supposed to be 6 regular assignments (last assignment on small `e` case of RSA), and a bonus assignment (on some miscellaneous topic), but as the last assignment did not work properly on the game server, it was scrapped along with the bonus assignment.
